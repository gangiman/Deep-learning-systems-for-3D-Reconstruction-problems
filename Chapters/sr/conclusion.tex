\subsection{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}
In this work we present a deep neural network for multi-frame face super-resolution that performs alignment, reconstruction and recognition in holistic manner and learns respective modules in the end-to-end fashion. We evaluate different variants of the proposed architecture including single-image baseline. In the experiments on YouTube Faces dataset, we demonstrate the advantages of having the alignment module in the system. In the presence of alignment, we observe the improvement both in visual quality (confirmed by the user study) and in the face recognition accuracy over the single frame baselines and the single frame system \cite{ZhuLLT16}.
