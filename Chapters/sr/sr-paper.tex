\section{Multi-frame face super-resolution}


\begin{abstract}

Face verification and recognition problems have seen rapid progress in recent years, however recognition from small size images remains a challenging task that is inherently intertwined with the task of face super-resolution. Tackling this problem using multiple frames is an attractive idea, yet requires solving the alignment problem that is also challenging for low-resolution faces. Here we present a holistic system for multi-frame recognition, alignment, and superresolution of faces. Our neural network architecture restores the central frame of each input sequence additionally taking into account a number of adjacent frames and making use of sub-pixel movements. We present our results using the popular dataset for video face recognition (YouTube Faces). We show a notable improvement of identification score compared to several baselines including the one based on single-image super-resolution.
