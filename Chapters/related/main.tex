\section{Shape Retrieval}
\label{sec:shape_retrieval}

Many papers about how to take a codified shape of an object or scanned data and find record in a shape database. Many aspects related to completeness of database and other retrieval problems.

\section{Geometric Reconstruction}
\label{sec:geometric_reconstruction}

About SLAM methods or bundle adjustment problems where the semantic properties or nature of objects is not known.

In recent years multiple models for Depth prediction from 2D image were able to improve performance because of either additional information or by using a better model \cite{jiao2018look,tatarchenko2019single,kendall2018multi}.

\label{sec:retrieval_reconstruction}

Scan2Cad and simmilar methods which use retrival as way to "explain" registered signals.

\section{Uncertainty in Reconstruction}
\label{sec:uncertainty_reconstruction}

About role of prior knowledge and how it's represented in various models. a tie-in with deep depth-image prior.

\section{Part-aware Reconstruction}
\label{sec:part_reconstruction}

\input Chapters/related/scan2part.tex

About inductive bias and an ability to construct complicated objects from parts, adding hierarchy to scene ontology.
