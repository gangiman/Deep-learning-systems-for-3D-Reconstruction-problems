\section{Datasets}

Only recently research community started accumuulating sugnifficant amount of algined sensor data to solve large scale 3D reconstruction problems in deep learning context. In last 4 years we saw an explosion of 3D shape databases and 2D-to-3D indoor scene datasets, such as ShapeNet, 2D-3D Semantic, Scannet and Matterport3D datasets. Because accuracy and reacall properties of deep learning models scale with amount and variety of data, number of state-of-the-art models grew as well.
